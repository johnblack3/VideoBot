This is the first part of a video series on using machine learning to predict QB passing yards. In this video, we're pulling data from nfl-data-py and manipulating it to later feed it into the regression model. This is going to be an end-to-end project taking NFL data and creating a machine learning model that can make predictions.

If you've ever wanted to get started with sports machine learning this is the place to be.

I use u/NukishPhilosphy's idea over on r/fantasyfootballcoding of an exponentially weighted moving average to look at a QB and defense's performance over the past 10 games, but more heavily weighting recency to pick up on trends quickly. He talked about it in this post on Open Source Football:

5,0.0,51.0,"Hi,

I am a member of the pandas core team (phofl on github). We are currently working on a new feature called Copy on Write. It is designed to get rid of all the inconsistencies in indexing operations. The feature is still actively developed. We would love to get feedback and general thoughts on this, since it will be a pretty substantial change. I wrote a post showing some different forms of behavior in indexing operations and how Copy on Write impacts them:

I can automate using like pyautogui or whatever if on the active window but no clue how to do it while watching netflix, saw a thread about someone making something for 2 wow accounts (one is the player, the background player being an automated healer etc) so it is probably possible. I'd rather stay with python but if someone has already made the program for like another language that I've only gotta like change a few lines I don't mind doing that.

I've been developing a game engine as a learning exercise -- it's a (very) simple Entity-Component-System game engine for Python, built on Pygame, with an emphasis on ease of use.

[https://github.com/rik-cross/gamma](https://github.com/rik-cross/gamma)

It's not quite finished, but lots of functionality has been added. I don't have any documentation, but put together a short video series to show how to use the engine to create a simple coin-collecting game.
