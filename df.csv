He takes me on dates and spoils me and he’s really nice to me but he wants sex all the time and in my mind it makes me wonder why he doesn’t want a girl his own age

4,0.0,1.0,"I’m somewhat suicidal and I can’t actually plan out how I want to do it. My mom is trying everything to help and she’s suffering so much to try and help me get but up and keep fighting. I can’t sleep at night and on the off chance I do it’s for 30 min to an hour and all my dreams are filled with nightmares. Iv been like this since I was a kid. Every day feels like torture and iv gotten so well at masking it that for over a decade and a half no one has noticed a single thing. I take my meds, I go out with friends and try to be active, i exercise. Yet I still feel just as miserable as before. Nothing brings me joy. Nothing brings me happiness. I can’t plan my own death because of how hard my mom is trying to save me. If I were to just leave the house today knowing I’m going to take my own life, I feel like I would be cheating me mom. Ik she loves me and she means well, but I am extremely miss understood and every time I reach out for help people just look at me and say “there’s no way your depressed, you always make people laugh and make them happy. Your probably just sad and not use to it.”Its exhausting living like this. I can no longer cry or show sad emotions. My face just looks numb when I’m alone. I feel like a burden to my mom. She’s trying to fix something that is totally broken. She’s trying to put me back together but she’s missing all the pieces. She’s looking for something that doesn’t exist. I want out of this life but I don’t know how to tell her. Iv come to the decision that if the opportunity of death shows it’s self then I will take it. Until then I will sit here and suffer and watch my mother try to help, knowing that I’m already gone. It’s all just a matter time before I take action",confessions,I act happy but I don’t want to be here,1.0,1.0

My sister (11) has been throwing tantrums and moping because my mum won’t get her a a frank green ($60 water bottle) along with an iPhone 14, a poppy Lismon bag and a gel nail polish kit along with some t shirts. She’s been complaining and gossiping to me about it since she’s gotten into 10 fights with my mum about it and it’s just so infuriating. I admit we’re not struggling with money but we also aren’t rich and honestly I think her reaction to not getting a water bottle is just sad.",confessions,My sister is crying over her presents and it’s getting annoying,2.0,1.0
6,0.0,1.0,"So yeah as the title says there is a girl who has a crush on me. She is a 17 years old girl meanwhile im a 19 year old female turning 20 soon. I dont have any feelings towards her. I’m in love with her friend who is the same age as me.But thats not the topic we are going to talk about. The issue is that i keep seeing her getting bold with me everytime i meet her. (If you are wondering why we are meeting each other its because originally we are a group of 5 girls, and like if we hang out we always do it together) so she gets to come along. At first i thought she was just being friendly towards me but .. She always hugs me tightly, gets close to my face when she stands next to me, maintains eye contact with me and gets shy when i catch her doing so. Locks her hands with mine when we all walk together. Starts slowly caressing my hand…Gets red when she sees me. I view her as a really good friend and i dont want to hurt her feelings, so im not  sure how i can make her stop doing this type of stuff :///",confessions,Minor is in love with me..,1.0,1.0
7,0.0,1.0,"When I was a kid/teen I constantly was abused. Not going into huge detail but a lot of it was from my dad. One of the things he did frequently, especially in my teen years was pin me down and scream in my face. Sweat, spittles, bad breath, and all. Wrists squeezed so tight I would loose circulation and my hands would go cold. For a little more perspective I am currently 5’1 as an adult woman and weigh about 110 lbs most of the time. At the time I was probably under 5” and around 80lbs. My dad on the other hand 5’7 weighing about 185lbs at the time. He would have me pinned down sometimes for hours and so of course I would try to escape which only made things worse and he would apply more weight. When this would happen most of the time my older brother would mind his business because, he didn’t want it done to him I’m sure. But there was one instance where my dad was doing this, and my brother was with his girlfriend in the room next door. It was getting bad and I started to cry begging for my big brother to save me. After a while of this, my brothers girlfriend told him that my screams were getting weaker, meaning I couldn’t breathe. I heard his door open up very quickly and next thing I knew the weight of this fat jerk was coming off of me, instant relief. I immediately get up and assess how my brother, who also was on the smaller side, was able to get him off. That’s when I saw my dad head locked in my brothers arms turning purple in the face. My initial thought was good let the asshole struggle for air and die I would finally be free from his never ending over the top punishments. I proceeded to let him sit like that for a good minute before I told my brother to stop. I wasn’t concerned at all about my dad getting killed, as much as I was about my brother getting in trouble for it. My brother was hesitant, so I had to actually scream at him “you’re going to kill him.” Afterwards my brother just up and left the room and my dad got up stunned, tired, and embarrassed. Left without saying a word to anybody. Still to this day I am thankful my brother was there and prepared to do what he had to protect me even if it meant he got hurt or went to prison.",confessions,My brother almost killed my dad TW abuse involved,1.0,1.0
