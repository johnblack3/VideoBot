2,Temperature-Still,0.0,7.0,"In college, I never joined a fraternity but became good friends with some of the guys in the frat without paying the fees (strongly recommend this route). Being that we were friends, I got invited to a lot of their parties and private gatherings. It began as a drunken gag where I would take a small item (salt shaker, fridge magnet, kitchen utensil, etc.) but over time I began to try and one-up myself. My favorite item to procure were the plastic knobs to the range on the oven. At one point; over multiple different houses/parties, I gathered a total of like 16 different knobs. From one house alone having multiple parties throughout the year, I ended owning all but one knob so they had to pull the knob off and use it for the other burners on the oven. Years after graduating, I heard from acquaintances that multiple people had lost their deposits because of my debauchery . I regret nothing.",confession,r/confession,Iâ€™ve stolen an item from every college party Iâ€™ve ever been to..,7.0,0.67

This daycare was hectic little goblin kids running around everywhere one kid left a huge scar on my with there bear nails, but thatâ€™s a story for another day. So anyway in this room full of very tiny children (like just learned how to walk) we where playing tag and while Iâ€™m running thereâ€™s this little kid in front of me. To the right of me is a tv to the left is my little brother. I have no choice but to trip him or plow over the toddler. I trip my brother and keep running, luckily no one had noticed but then thereâ€™s a crack and crying. I stop to see what happened and thereâ€™s my little brother sobbing on the floor holding his arm.

6,russrussrussrussruss,0.0,1.0,"I function fairly well, by otherâ€™s standards. I have a job, I live on my own, I pay for most everything in my life. I donâ€™t hold myself to otherâ€™s standards, Iâ€™ve done a lot of research into the mind trying to improve myself so I know most of the detrimental things to avoid. I also know that I should take pride in these things myself without acknowledgment from others and focus on the things Iâ€™ve done, the positive aspects of my life, and not compare myself to anyone else. Despite all this, I am miserable. My mind is constantly filled with negativity, my emotions are dull unless I slip and start degrading myself which brings out anger, regret, and sadness. These should not be the only emotions I feel, and I should allow myself to feel positive emotions. 

I (at least I think) had a stroke, about 1 1/2 years ago. I didnâ€™t get medical treatment, as I wasnâ€™t aware of it. But, Iâ€™ve gone to an emergency room recently and they said that, to them, it didnâ€™t seem like it. And If something similar did happen, and it was that long ago, itâ€™s not something to worry about. It still lingers in my mind. But, Iâ€™m also a deeply paranoid person, one of my friends even called me crazy (semi-jokingly, heâ€™s aware of all of the above) and heâ€™s not entirely wrong. Iâ€™m always unsure where paranoia ends and rational fear begins. Besides a stroke, I am fairly certain I have brain damage, the symptoms are all there. But, I can function. I can type. I can think semi properly. These are things I think about whenever it pops into mind to keep myself in good spirits. 

Regardless, I still feel lost every day. I feel as though the progress I have made is minuscule. The road ahead is always long, and it has been a relatively short amount of time on my road, but it still seems near impossible. Thank you for listening, I really just needed to vent a little bit.
