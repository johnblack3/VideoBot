Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday he does not plan to sell any more shares of Tesla for at least the next two years, after the billionaire and nascent Twitter owner offloaded nearly $3.6 billion worth of stock this week as Tesla's share price tumbled.

Musk said during a Twitter Spaces audio call he will stop offloading Tesla stock after selling nearly $40 billion worth of it in the past year.

Tesla's share price dropped nearly 9% Thursday to close at $125.35, as investors grow increasingly concerned about demand for the company’s electric vehicles and leery of the massive amount of time Musk is devoting to running Twitter.

The drop put Tesla nearly 70% of its all-time high in January, when the stock at its peak traded above $400 and Tesla's market capitalization swelled to $1.2 trillion—pushing Musk’s net worth, which is mostly made up of Tesla shares, above $300 billion.",stocks,r/stocks,Musk Promises Not To Sell More Tesla Stock—But He’s Broken Vow Before,1573.0,0.87
1,k_ristovski,0.0,164.0,"Tesla ($TSLA) is down 69% YTD. Although this is a number that Elon musk normally finds funny, I think, in this case, he might make an exception.

In my opinion, there are 5 reasons that led to the collapse of the share price and the goal of this post is to lay them down as well as the impact of each.

***Part 2 will follow on the valuation in full (including all assumptions made) - This post became too long and in my experience, extremely long posts do poorly.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason #1: Elon Musk acquired Twitter - leading to him having less time available for Tesla**

Although Elon Musk is involved in many companies other than Tesla (SpaceX, The boring company, Neuralink), there is no doubt that Twitter is the one taking most of his time at this very moment. This acquisition wasn't welcomed by the shareholders of Tesla.

**The impact:** In my opinion, the role of Elon Musk in all companies is to find the right people for the right positions and assemble teams that do the job well. Then, it's all about translating his vision into actions. The better the teams are executing, the less Elon Musk is needed on daily basis. Although this event had an impact on the time he spends on Tesla, I'm sure if there's a critical decision, Elon will give priority to Tesla over Twitter. Hence, looking into the future, I cannot imagine that Tesla's performance (from a fundamental point of view) will deteriorate.

**Reason #2: Insiders selling**

Over the last 365 days, there has been a lot of insider selling.

|Name|\# of shares sold|Average price|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Elon Musk|97,004,591|$246.94|$23,954,081,846|
|Vaibhav Taneja|58,683|$337.81|$19,823,747|
|Zach Kirkhorn|52,418|$253.05|$13,264,312|
|Drew Balgino|147,601|$277.45|$40,951,954|
|Kathleen Wilson-Thompson|105,000|$289.03|$30,348,062|
|Robyn M Denholm|299,700|$284.84|$85,366,262|
|**Total**|**97,667,993**|**$247.20**|**$24,143,836,183**|

Of course, it is obvious that the biggest sale was in order to acquire Twitter and most recently (in December) to secure more funds as Twitter is not profitable.

However, there have been many insiders in high-level positions who were selling shares and the average price is almost always above $250 (more than 2x where the share price is today). In my opinion, they were selling as the company was **overvalued.** Could I be wrong? Absolutely.

**The impact:** Economics101 - when there's a significant change in supply/demand, there's a change in the price. When there is over $24b worth of shares dumped on the market, it causes a decline in the share price. Was this a significant reason for the decline? Absolutely! Do I blame the insiders? Not really, it is their choice to sell shares. As for Elon, I don't think that if his ownership is up or down by a few %, it has an impact on the level of involvement.

**Reason #3: FED increase in interest rate**

So far, this is what Elon Musk has been pointing to the most as an explanation for the share price decline. Although the increase from 0% to 4% treasury rate has an impact on the valuation of companies, it **does not** justify a decrease of 69%. Blaming the rate hikes for a stock price fall is the same as saying the stock was overvalued before, based on artificially cheap money.

Elon Musk in a Twitter Space conversation referred to the real interest rate being close to 6%. What does this mean? The nominal interest rate is somewhere around 4%, which means, he believes the inflation is negative 2% - We're in deflation. In the same conversation, he mentioned that the FED is using outdated data to make decisions today. Is he right or wrong, well, it's difficult to prove as there's no such data publicly available.

**The impact:** I do believe that this was responsible for roughly 30% of the decline of the share price, but it was pretty much normalizing back from an artificially inflated level. However, this is already embedded in the share price today. If Elon is right and we are in deflation, the FED will decrease rates which will push the share price up in the future.

**Reason #4: Interest rate impact on Tesla's business**

If you buy a car or a house and you pay for it in case, well, it doesn't matter whether the interest rate is 0% or 10%, you're not getting any loan. However, the majority of such purchases are made using a loan.

If we take a look at the total cost paid by the buyer, it is equal to the cost of the car (What Tesla is being paid) + the cost of debt (in the form of interest). Hence, even if Tesla keeps the prices exactly the same, the cost from a buyer's perspective increases when interest rates go up.

So, what can Tesla do? There are 2 options:

1. Keep prices the same - This will lead to lower volume sold, but profitability (on a unit level) remains the same.
2. Lower the price - This will lead to higher volume, but lower profitability (on a unit level)

Based on the conversation in Twitter Spaces, it seems as if Tesla it is more likely to go for the second option and focus on selling more cars.

**The impact:** In the short run, it might seem like a bad decision, but I do believe it is the right decision in the long run. They'll be able to expose more customers to their products and increase market share. There's no car company that is better positioned to make a decision such as this one.

**Reason #5: It was overvalued in the first place**

None of the reasons above and all of them combined, do not justify the 69% price drop. There were many Tesla bears shouting that the stock was overvalued above $200, let alone at $400/share. I've valued Tesla multiple times in the last few years and I got to the same conclusion over and over again. I couldn't justify the high price based on the fundamentals.

**So, why am I buying?**

Based on my assumptions, Tesla is fairly valued at around $600b (roughly $190/share). That's why in November I opened a Tesla position and increased it during December. None of the reasons above have a significant negative forward-looking impact.

The market tends to have short-term memory. The focus is on the 69% YTD decline, however, it's still up almost 500% in the last 5 years!

The sentiment has shifted significantly, from everything going right for Tesla, optimism about AI day, Optimus leading to wishful thinking, to more realistic thinking, and now more recently, panic selling.

Could I be wrong? Absolutely! This is just my take.
